#TwemojIcons

A simple CSS framework built to implement Twemojis _(designed by Twitter)_ easily like FontAwesome.

TwemojIcons are based on Twemojis v2.2 which offers 2,477 emojis which can now be used in websites with a simple and minimal code. 

##Dependencies

TwemojIcons depends on the Twemoji CDN by MaxCDN and obtains the scalable vector graphics for the emojis from them. 

###Usage

TwemojIcons are simple to implement.

Just include the `twemojicons.min.css` along with the resources on your website. 

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/twemojicons.min.css">
```

Add the code `<i class="ti emoji_name"></i>` at the place where you want the emoji to appear on your site. 

You can also add `spin`, `rotate-*` and `flip-*` classes to the emojis to add the various effects.

A full list of emoji names can be found <a href="http://atulbhats.com/">Here</a>.

---

This project was built to provide an easy access to the Twemojis available for web development and design. Although inspired by various projects, No code has been plagarized 'as is' and no design in the emojis has been modified or misused. 

Feedback is always welcome.
